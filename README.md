# EXT2-Copy

The goal of this source code is to design a set of programs to copy files from a Linux ext2 filesystem, and to display directory contents of an ext2 filesystem. Notice that this source assumes that the user is concerned with a loopback filesystem. Every component of this source was written by me and has not been updated or improved since May 2012.
